 filter is used to specify which processes to list:
  - All: all processes
  - Pgrp: processes in the same process group as the current process
  - Tty: processes with the same controlling terminal as the current process
  - Uid: processes with the same real user id as the current process
  - Ruid: processes with the same effective user id as the current process
  - Ppid: processes with the same parent process id as the current process
  - Kdbg: processes with the same kernel debugger as the current process

  The function `list` retrieves a list of process IDs based on a specified filter.

  @param f A filter of type `filter` which specifies the type of processes to list. The filter can be one of the following:
    - All: all processes
    - Pgrp: processes in the same process group as the current process
    - Tty: processes with the same controlling terminal as the current process
    - Uid: processes with the same real user id as the current process
    - Ruid: processes with the same effective user id as the current process
    - Ppid: processes with the same parent process id as the current process
    - Kdbg: processes with the same kernel debugger as the current process

  It calls `proc_listpids` forein function under the hood.

  @return A list of integers representing the process IDs of the processes that match the specified filter.
